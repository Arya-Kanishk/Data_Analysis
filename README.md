# Titanic Data Analysis and Feature Engineering


In Computer Sciences, phrases like Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Data Science, have end up so famous in a quick period of time due to the energy those regions have. 
This repository contains an in-depth analysis and feature engineering for the Titanic dataset, aiming to predict the survival of passengers.
Here I am doing an in depth exploratory statistics analysis (EDA) at the Titanic dataset. And all of us recognise EDA is the maximum essential component to construct an awesome Machine Learning or Artificial intelligence Model. The goal of this weblog is to behaviour EDA and statistical modelling at the Titanic Dataset which will accumulate insights and eventually expect who survived and why? Out of the 891 passengers that went on board, about 38% of them survived wherein as majority 62% did now no longer live to tell the tale the disaster. In this weblog I even have analysed every column one by one and in terms of Survived column that's the goal characteristic here.

### Introduction
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used for binary classification tasks in machine learning. This project explores various data analysis techniques and feature engineering strategies to improve the predictive performance of machine learning models in determining passenger survival.

### Data
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It includes information on the passengers such as age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not.

•	Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

•	Columns:

  o	PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
  
  o	Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
  
  o	Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
  
  o	Name: Name of the passenger
  
  o	Sex: Gender of the passenger
  
  o	Age: Age of the passenger
  
  o	SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
  
  o	Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
  
  o	Ticket: Ticket number
  
  o	Fare: Passenger fare
  
  o	Cabin: Cabin number
  
  o	Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Methodology

The project follows these steps:

#### 1.	Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:

o	Handling missing values
o	Converting categorical features to numerical
o	Feature scaling

#### 2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

o	Understanding the distribution of features
o	Identifying correlations and patterns
o	Visualizing data with charts and plots

#### 3.	Feature Engineering:

o	Creating new features from existing ones
o	Encoding categorical variables
o	Handling outliers

## Results

The project demonstrates the impact of feature engineering on model performance. The key findings include:

•	Certain features like Pclass, Sex, and Age have a significant impact on survival prediction.

•	Feature engineering can improve model accuracy and generalization.

Include visualizations, charts, and tables that summarize your findings.
